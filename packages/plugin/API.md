# Introduction
## Theia Plugin system description

### Command API
 A command is a unique identifier of a function which
 can be executed by a user via a keyboard shortcut, a
 menu action or directly.

Commands can be added using the [registerCommand](#commands.registerCommand) and
[registerTextEditorCommand](#commands.registerTextEditorCommand) functions.
Registration can be split in two step: first register command without handler, 
second register handler by command id.

Any contributed command are available to any plugin, command can be invoked 
by [executeCommand](#commands.executeCommand) function.

Simple example that register command:
```javascript
theia.commands.registerCommand({id:'say.hello.command'}, ()=>{
    console.log("Hello World!");
});
```

Simple example that invoke command:

```javascript
theia.commands.executeCommand('core.about');
```

### window

Common namespace for dealing with window and editor, showing messages and user input.

#### Quick Pick

Function to ask user select some value from the list.

Example of using:

```javascript
//configure quick pick options
 const option: theia.QuickPickOptions = {
        machOnDescription: true,
        machOnDetail: true,
        canPickMany: false,
        placeHolder: "Select string:",
        onDidSelectItem: (item) => console.log(`Item ${item} is selected`)
    };
 // call Theia api to show quick pick
theia.window.showQuickPick(["foo", "bar", "foobar"], option).then((val: string[] | undefined) => {
        console.log(`Quick Pick Selected: ${val}`);
    });
```
